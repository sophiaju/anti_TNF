# anti_TNF
Research project on rheumatoid arthritis patient response to anti_TNF treatment

- Implemented machine learning models for the genomic data of rheumatoid arthritis patients to predict how well they will respond to anti-TNF treatments under supervision of Professor Yue Li
- Created bash and plink1.9 scripts to format and clean a dataset of 2,706 patients and about 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms
- Utilized scikit-learn in Python to train various regression models to predict response
- learned R to process RNAseq data and create visualizations
- Selected for oral abstract presentation at European Congress of Rheumatology EULAR 2021
